  "aboutpara": "Hi, Iâ€™m Devansh Sharmaâ€”a computer-vision grad student at the University of Central Florida who loves turning messy, real-world data into working products. After earning an M.S. in Computer Science at Bowling Green State University, I spent a summer at Fellowship.AI building a pose-based activity-recognition pipeline that hit 96 % accuracy and shipped as an end-to-end demo. My research on evaluating object detectors for vulnerable pedestrians was accepted to IEEE ITSC 2024, reflecting my drive to push safety-critical CV forward. Beyond academia, Iâ€™ve spun up Kafka streams on AWS, orchestrated Airflow DAGs, and trained models that range from Extra Trees to YOLOv4. When Iâ€™m not experimenting with code, youâ€™ll find me mentoring undergrads as a teaching assistant or hacking on open-source projects. Iâ€™m excited by problems that blend solid engineering with thoughtful MLâ€”and Iâ€™m always looking for teams that value curiosity, clean code, and measurable impact.",

    "description": "Iâ€™ve built an end-to-end pose-based activity-recognition pipeline that turns raw video into real-time action labels with â‰ˆ96 % F1, served through FastAPI on AWS. I curated a 20 k-frame benchmark of cyclists, pedestrians, and motorbikes, then evaluated YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet under rain, glare, and night conditions to steer ADAS safety choices. Most recently, I combined YOLOv4, DeepSORT, and projective geometry in a Dockerised micro-service that measures vehicle speed from a single traffic-camera feed to within Â±4 km/h, now powering a smart-city congestion pilot.",
